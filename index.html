        <h3>My Story</h3>
        <p> I like so many people, at the beginning of the pandemic, during that time of unrest and for so many reasons, found myself in a heightened state of anxiety.  I didn't like feeling helpless or this heightened state of anxiety.  It took me a minute (a few months) to start searching for a solution to ease myself.  
        Soon after I began looking I found on youtube a Joe Rogan podcast episode that sparked my interest.  It was called “Why Being a “Mouth-breather” Is Bad For You" w/James Nestor. This was the beginning of trip down the breathing rabbit hole.  The life-changing take away I discovered is how we breathe affects everything about us including our beautiful brains.  This website offers some simple concepts and tools to help you breathe for a better brain. There's a little anatomy and a bit of science too.

        <h7>Introduction to Better Breathing and A Better Brain</h7>
        <p>We can survive about 3 weeks without food, about 3 days without water and for most of us about 3 minutes without air. Each and every day of our lives we take 23,000 to 25,000 breaths. We do it whether we think about it or not, it’s part of the autonomic nervous system.  Luckily for us it is also something we do have control over if we are conscious of it and do a little practicing. 
            The following foundations and techniques are practical, easy and take only a minute to learn. I've referenced articles and videos along the way.  Please reach out if you have questions, comments or suggestions. Let's get started!</p>

        <h6>Pay Attention to How You Breathe</h6>
        <p>Take a moment without trying to change anything and just notice your breath.  Notice the air moving in and out, are you breathing with your nose or with your mouth, no judgement just notice.  Notice if your upper chest is moving as you breathe or does the bottom of your rib cab move in and out?  Does your breath have a rhythm? Becoming aware of the breath is the first step to breathing.  Congratulations!<br>The next step is to see how it feels when you slow down the breath. See if you can let your exhale extend a few seconds lower than the inhale.  An easy way to try is to count as you inhale for 4 or 5 seconds and then try and exhale for 8 or 9 seconds.  It takes a little practice but this rhythm of breathing tells your body to relax and your mind slows down with it. You might feel more saliva or you might feel your shoulders drop. When we relax naturally, we breathe more slowly, our whole system relaxes, it's our rest and digest state which takes place in the parasympathetic nervous system. Unless we are in an emergency, we want to spend most of our time here in the parasympathetic nervous system.  For the most part when we are relaxed our brains function better.</p>

        <h5>Engage the Diaphragm</h5>
        <img id=diaphragm class="respiratory" src="img/ressystem.jpg" alt="illustration of the respiratory system" style="width:250px;height:350px">
        <p>There are so many reasons to breathe predominantly from the diaphragm, including improved posture, reduced tension in the upper chest muscles, more efficient gas exchange, stimulation of the relaxation response and reduced blood pressure. Also, because the diaphragm plays a vital role in massaging the internal organs, breathing mainly from the diaphragm facilitates improved digestion, bowel function and movement of blood and lymphatic fluid. It is impossible overstate the importance of diaphragm breathing for health and wellbeing.</p>

        <h4>Breathe Through Your Nose</h4>
        <img id="nose" class="nosebreathe" src="img/nosebreathe.jpg" alt="illustrated profile of a person breathing" style="width:200px;height:220px">
        <p>Breathing may be the most natural thing in the world. Did you know that most of the time, the right way to breathe is through the nose? We know that our nose filters out dust.  The nasal passage conditions the air,  warms or cools it, and also pressurizes it.  We produce nitrogen oxide in the nasal passage, NO is an antibacterial and aids the blood vessels in the airways to expand to better the oxygen, carbon dioxide exchange.  
            Nasal breathing boosts the brains visual spatial power and also helps harmonize cognitive brain function<br>
            Nasal breathing aids in how well our memories are consolidated. Nasal breathing activates the diaphragm, our diaphragm is our biggest respiratory muscle.<br>
