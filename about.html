        <h2>My breathing for a better brain journey</h2>
        <p>My “health and self awareness” journey started in my 30s. I had a desire to take better care of myself.  I went to Shiatsu school for 2 years and fell in love with the eastern view points of the body and how to care for it.  Later, I went on to study massage, I’ve studied several types of energy healing modalities including “Shinkiko” energy healing and a modality called “Reconnective” healing.  I’ve been a NASM personal trainer, I’ve cared for the elderly and helped a friend with Parkinson’s. I’ve studied herbs and taken classes using essential oils.  I finished a year long training learning about raw foods. 
            My body care interest was all about food for a couple of years and I think it is important and how much water you drink is important and then there’s the amazing breath!  
            <br><br>2 years before the pandemic, I became curious about Wim Hof breathing and took a 6 week course he offered. His breath work accompanied by cold therapy stresses the body in a controlled environment allowing you to be more adaptable to every day stressors. I also played around with a breathing method called “Shamanic breathing” and held my breath for 4 minutes and 30 seconds!  It’s super trippy!  When the pandemic hit, I was practicing the Wim Hof method but wanted to see if there was something more that I could do through out my day to relieve anxiety.  I found a podcast that led me to James Nestor’s book “Breath”. He’s a journalist who became interested in the breath after spending time with free divers while writing another book called “Deep”.  I highly recommend both! While writing his book Breath, Nestor’s researched and interviewed many scientists and breath specialists.  As I read Breath, whenever Nestor mentioned a scientist or breath expert, I would research what they did and if they offered more training if their method interested me.  I took free diver, Stig Severinsen’s class called Breathology.  I completed Brian Mackensie’s Shift Adapt beginners course for athletic performance.  I am currently taking two of Patrick McKeown’s breath courses; Oxygen Advantage and The Buteyko method.  My current desire aka obsession is learning to free dive.  My best dry land breath hold is 3 minutes.</p>
